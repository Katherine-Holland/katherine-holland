## Hi there 👋
Hey there, I’m a UK-based AI Engineer and full-stack developer with a focus on building real-world Generative AI applications that solve communication, insight, and compliance challenges.

I’ve recently developed two major AI platforms:

Seekle — an AI-powered SEO intelligence tool that analyses how AI systems index and interpret website content, built using Python, FastAPI, LLM APIs, async crawlers and AWS.

Ethicali — an AI assurance platform that evaluates datasets and algorithms against frameworks such as the EU AI Act, using modular Python validator nodes, FastAPI and secure AWS architecture.

Alongside this, I’ve completed the Code Institute Full-Stack Software Development Diploma (2024–2025), where I trained in Python, Pandas, REST APIs, Agile delivery and built a supervised machine learning project in Jupyter Notebook (a classifier that detects mould in cherry leaves).

I’m passionate about creating AI tools that are safe, transparent and genuinely useful — especially in public-sector and communication contexts.
This portfolio showcases my work, code samples, experiments and hands-on projects.

Feel free to explore my repositories below!

## Fun Facts:

- I specialised in Predictive Analytics with the Code Institute and studied Machine Learning with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online via Coursera (Taught by Andrew Ng). The latter course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including: supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation. Andrew Ng also tells great Dad jokes.
  
In my spare time I like to create digital art. I also like prompting in LumaLabs.ai. Here's one of my favourite videos that I created:
