## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Katherine and I am currently a student with the Code Institute studying for a Full Stack Developer Diploma. I'm also studying with Coursera. I am interested in Machine Learning, Data Science and Quantitative Finance.

- This month ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Predictive Analytics with the Code Institute and Machine Learning with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online via Coursera (Taught by Andrew Ng). The latter course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including: supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation. Andrew Ng also tells great Dad jokes.
  
- I'm also obsessed with prompting. I like to use LumaLabs.ai. Here's one of my favourite videos that I created:
