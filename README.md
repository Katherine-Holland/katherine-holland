## Hi there üëã
I'm a future-focused Blockchain Engineer | Currently building a beginner-friendly DEX with smart contract safeguards, abstraction logic & AI-powered tooling.

I‚Äôm a newly qualified Full-Stack Developer upskilling into Web3 ‚Äî combining my recent Diploma in Full Stack Development (with a specialization in predictive analytics) with hands-on smart contract experience. I'm currently completing a blockchain bootcamp, diving deep into Solidity, the EVM, Layer 2 scaling, ERC-20 tokens, and consensus protocols, while building real-world Web3 projects that emphasize security and usability.

üîß Projects I‚Äôm working on:

A decentralized exchange (DEX) using React.js, Ethers.js, Hardhat, and Tailwind CSS, featuring a smart contract-level buffer system to reduce transaction errors

A smart contract wallet with account abstraction logic for transaction acknowledgment and delayed confirmation

AI-powered tools for smart contract auditing and debugging, blending blockchain with intelligent automation

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
Solidity ‚Ä¢ Ethers.js ‚Ä¢ Hardhat ‚Ä¢ React.js ‚Ä¢ Next.js ‚Ä¢ Redux ‚Ä¢ Web3.js ‚Ä¢ Python ‚Ä¢ Tailwind CSS ‚Ä¢ Solana (exploring)

I‚Äôm driven by a passion for building ethical, human-centered Web3 applications that scale ‚Äî and I‚Äôm looking for a Blockchain Engineer role where I can keep growing, ship real tools, and help shape the future of decentralized tech.

## Fun Facts:

- I specialised in Predictive Analytics with the Code Institute and studied Machine Learning with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online via Coursera (Taught by Andrew Ng). The latter course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including: supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation. Andrew Ng also tells great Dad jokes.
  
In my spare time I like to create digital art. I also like prompting in LumaLabs.ai. Here's one of my favourite videos that I created:
