## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Katherine and I have just graduated with the Code Institute as a Full Stack Developer. I am interested in Quality Assurance, Machine Learning, Data Science and Quantitative Finance.

- I specialised in Predictive Analytics with the Code Institute and learnt Machine Learning with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online via Coursera (Taught by Andrew Ng). The latter course provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including: supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation. Andrew Ng also tells great Dad jokes.

## Fun Facts:
Iâ€™m currently working on:
  1) An Ai Assurance website.
  2) A Cryptocurrency exchange... for fun.
  3) In my spare time I like to create digital art. I also like prompting in LumaLabs.ai. Here's one of my favourite videos that I created:
